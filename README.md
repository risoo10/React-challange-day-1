# Personal REACT Challenge (Day 1) - Simple Chat App

## Personal challenge
I commited myself to get better with React and started 
this challange to create **one simple react app** every 
single day for the next 7 days. 

I was only a beginner at the beginning, I read few tutorials
on the web, but I wanted to know how I can fully work with 
React. So I started this challenge.

I expect to get real know-how of React and start thinking
in "Component-State-Props" philosophy. 

My challange consisted of:
- HTML Markup
- CSS styling with Styled Components
- REACT interactions, components, states

## Day 1 - Simple Chat App
I got inspired by cool redesign of the Messenger app, which I 
found at Behance.

I developed single page that contained only:
- Chat info and status
- Messages with time and avatar
- Input for sending new message
